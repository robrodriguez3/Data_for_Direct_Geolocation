# Data_for_Direct_Geolocation
Contains data for the evaluation of the performance of the Direct Geolocation code in the associated repository github.com/robrodriguez3/Direct_Geolocation.<br />
<br />
Data Listing:<br />
-Altitude_and_Pitch_Evaluation_Data.csv: Geolocation coordinates generated during initial field trials testing three altitude (30 m, 40 m, and 50 m) and three camera pitches (0, 15, 30).<br />
-Direct_Geolocation_and_SfM_Error_Data.csv: Table containing error calculations for miconia plant coordinates generated using the developed methods based on human selected positions and mean positions for deep neural netowrk (DNN) and coordinates calculated using Structure from Motion (SfM).<br />
-DNN_Leaf_Detections_Raw_Pixel_Data.csv: Pixel coordinates of miconia leaf detections using a previously developed deep neural network (Rodriguez et al., 2021)<br />
-DNN_Leaf_Detections_Direct_Geolocation_Data.csv: Coordinates calculated using the developed method for each detection contained in the associated pixel data file.<br />
-Plant_Positions_dGNSS_Data.csv: Reference coordinates of miconia plants measured using dGNSS.
